The idea behind this project
While playing football I suddenly got the idea that I'm throwing a ball on the ground and by the next moment, it touches my hand, don't I turned it into a CSS animation.

How does it work
while loading the webpage on the browser from that moment only the ball will start to jump and you will be able to observe its dynamic shadow behavior.
