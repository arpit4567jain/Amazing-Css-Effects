Hii I'm a GSSoc22 contributor and I'm looking to make a pr request in this repo regarding my CSS animation project as Square shimmer loading animation.

The idea behind this project:
It is similar to the toggle menu option. That we used in the responsiveness
How does it work :
while loading the webpage on the browser in the left corner hamburger wll be there just by clicking you will be able to get nav link in the blob shape

for more details refers to this image
