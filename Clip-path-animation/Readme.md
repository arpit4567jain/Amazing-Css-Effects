Hii I'm a GSSoc22 contributor and I'm looking to make a pr request in this repo regarding my CSS animation project as clip-path content

The idea behind this project:
Whenever we need to put more info in less place we just use this technique

How does it work :
while loading the webpage on the browser in the right corner there will be an info icon when you will hover on it it will open content hidden in it

for more details refers to this image
