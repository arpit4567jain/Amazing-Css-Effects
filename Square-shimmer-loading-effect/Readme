The idea behind this project:
Nowadays our day starts with the internet and ends with the internet means we are spending lots of time digitally so we often experience buffering problems whenever there is weak bandwidth on the net or while sometimes visiting a new webpage takes time to display the stuff and in the starting, there was a loading animation that tells the user to stop for a while. So, the project idea is there only.

How does it work :
while loading the webpage on the browser in the middle of the webpage there is a diagonal shape title square within it there is many small square place with a loading effect so after loading the webpage it starts fading and glowing.
